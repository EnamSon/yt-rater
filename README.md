Millions of YouTube videos are uploaded daily. As users of this platform, we sometimes start
watching a video only to realize later that it wasn’t what we expected or the quality was poor.  
For this reason, we use AI to build a tool that ingests comments from a given YouTube video
and tells us how good this video is likely to be before we watch it.

# YT Rater

**YT Rater** is a web extension + local backend that automatically evaluates YouTube videos
based on their comments.  
The local server queries the YouTube API to fetch comments, then calls **Google Gemini**
to generate a score between **0.0 and 5.0**.  
This score is returned to the extension and displayed directly on the video (star rating).

## Work in Progress

This repository contains work-in-progress code and is not production-ready.
Use at your own risk, and expect frequent change.

## Features

- Fetches comments from a YouTube video using the official API  
- Analysis and scoring with Google Gemini (`google-genai`)  
- Local cache (avoids re-evaluation of recent videos)  
- Simple configuration stored in `~/.yt_rater/config.toml`  
- CLI (`yt-rater`) with two commands:  
  - `config` → create/show configuration  
  - `run` → start the local FastAPI server  

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.12+**
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnamSon/yt-rater.git
cd yt-rater
poetry build
poetry install
```

---

## Configuration
Get the configuration file:

```bash
poetry run yt-rater config
```

You need to enable YouTube Data API v3 in your Google Cloud project
and obtain an API key.
For Gemini, create a key from your Google AI Studio or Vertex AI account.

---

## Run the server

```bash
poetry run yt-rater run --port 8800
```

The server runs at http://localhost:8800
Available endpoint:
- POST /rate: receives { "url": "<video_url>" } and returns { "score": 4.2, "last_updated": "..." }

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/rate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
```

---

## Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

The tests use pytest and mock YouTube/Gemini calls, so they don’t consume real API quota.
